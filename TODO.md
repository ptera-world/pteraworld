# TODO

## Unfiltered content — potential essays
- [x] **housing** — folded into the-gate as "shelter" section
- [x] **extremism** → written as the-loop: the mechanism by which belief systems feed on their own resistance. no specific religions named
- [ ] **voice: questions vs statements** — main site uses rhetorical question headers (forces thinking, aids retention). unfiltered uses statements (forces recognition). headers should stay as statements. but body text could lean harder into unanswerable inline questions — not as technique, as honesty. places where the essay hits a wall and admits it. audit existing essays for opportunities

- [x] **force layout on grouping filters** — investigated: unfiltered has 0 groupings so issue can't manifest there. On default collection, switching groupings while filters are active skips force layout re-run (low priority edge case)
- [x] **main site introspective tags** — added `introspective` tag to 5 prose essays (the-great-deceit, this-site-is-manipulative, this-is-not-a-personal-website, this-site-is-designed, this-is-not-all) + tagColors on essays and meta-essays clusters

- [x] Add favicon / icon — SVG graph motif, linked in all entry points + generated content pages
- [x] Fix layout (broken by content-agnostic refactor) — resolved by layout engine rewrite
- [ ] `visible-at` constraint should not assume 1920×1080 — support multiple common viewport sizes or a range
- [x] Replace `center:` absolute coordinates in cluster YAMLs with relative constraints — already done, no clusters use `center:`
- [x] Implement force layout adaptive feedback loop: `runForceLayoutAdaptive` — 6 attempts, 4 quality axes, directional param adjustments
- [x] Wire essays cluster back to force layout via adaptive loop — essays use `layout: force` + `groupingPlacement: free`, force sim runs at step 6
- [ ] Implement dynamic layout: runtime viewport adaptation within tight bounds of build-time solution
- [x] Landing element overlap: runtime nudge after `document.fonts.ready` — measures landing bounding box, converts to world coordinates, pushes overlapping nodes radially outward
- [ ] Multiple meta nodes: currently all placed at (0,0) and camera picks the first one — define primary/secondary semantics, layout rules for multiple meta nodes, and camera centroid behavior
- [x] Concentric ring layout for large clusters — auto-splits into inner/outer rings when >10 items, with staggered placement

## Living graph — the graph as reading surface

The graph should be the primary way to experience the content. Essays are one format; fragments (short, graph-native thoughts) are another. The reading experience is spatial exploration, not linear consumption.

### Runtime behavior (all configurable, opinionated defaults)
- [x] **Dynamic layout on focus** — `src/focus-layout.ts`: animated force simulation via rAF, 2-hop neighborhood, gravity toward focused node. Collision-radius-aware repulsion. Smooth CSS translate transition on snap-back
- [x] **Neighborhood visibility** — `data-neighborhood="distant"` fades non-neighbors. Enabled via `?neighborhoodFocus=true`
- [x] **Text on canvas** — CSS for readable descriptions at near zoom. Enabled via `?textOnCanvas=true`. Currently uses frontmatter descriptions; richer content when fragments grow
- [x] **All behaviors configurable** — `src/settings.ts` with URL param loading. Settings: dynamicLayout, neighborhoodFocus, focusHighlight, edgesVisible, cardEnabled, nodeGrowth, textOnCanvas
- [x] **Hyperlink nodes** — portal nodes in `public/content/portal/` with `url:` fields that navigate to other collections on second click (first click shows card)
- [x] **Visual testing** — code review found and fixed 5 issues: undefined `stop()` crash on unfocus, text-on-canvas scale inverted at near zoom (0.45→0.85), `.node.project` class never assigned (tier visibility broken), neighborhood fading coupled to dynamic layout (now independent), neighborhood+filtered CSS interaction

### Content
- [x] **Fragment content type** — `public/content/cluster/fragments.md` + 55 fragments. Text-based rendering (no dot), `collisionRadius` from text dimensions, `.node.fragment` class. Clickable text hit target
- [x] **Fragment extraction** — 30 atomic ideas extracted from essay redundancy (documented in FRAGMENTS.md)
- [ ] **Essays as secondary format** — still linkable, still refined, but secondary to the graph. Could eventually be assembled dynamically from fragments based on view history (stored in query params)
- [x] **`/prose/` entrypoint** — essays at their own entrypoint (`/prose/`), freeing the default graph to be fragment-native
- [x] **New fragments** — 8 native fragments (explaining-changes-the-thing, maintenance-is-invisible, defaults-are-opinions, first-version-is-the-tool, thing-you-keep-circling, measuring-changes-what-gets-made, repetition-isnt-redundancy, legibility-is-the-bottleneck)
- [x] **Question fragments** — 8 question fragments with no body text, only edges. The neighborhood is the answer
- [ ] **More native fragments** — continue writing graph-shaped content

### Ongoing
- [ ] **Adversarial AI writing audits** — continue "prove this is AI-written" audits (like TELLS.md). Lower priority if essays become secondary or move to another entrypoint, but still valuable for the essay format
- [ ] **Tell 9** — future essays should emerge from specific, strange observations rather than addressing universal questions. A human writer notices something particular and works outward — not inward from a category
- [ ] **Remaining subtle tells (5a-g, 6a-b)** — paragraph rhythm homogeneity, metaphor uniformity, composed uncertainty, emotional register flatness, absence of disfluency, same voice across collections. 8 essays rewritten this session; ~60 remain. The voice section in CLAUDE.md now encodes the target positively. Consider handing rewrites to an agent with a curated voice rather than fighting Claude's defaults.
- [x] **Third adversarial audit** — completed 2026-03-23. Mechanical fixes landed well (genuinely eliminated, bold labels gone, See also 82%→26%, question headers 47%→23%). Subtle tells persist in ~60 non-rewritten essays (avg 1.54/3). Section count uniformity is now the #1 structural tell (89.5% in 5-8 range, worse than before). Three new tells found (9-11): cross-link density, explanatory parenthetical, second-person confrontation close. See TELLS.md.
