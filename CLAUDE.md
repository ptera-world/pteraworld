# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

Pteraworld is a personal portfolio website that renders projects as a spatial, zoom-based graph. Zero runtime dependencies, single-page app, all TypeScript. Deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Commands

```bash
bun install          # install dependencies
bun run dev          # dev server at localhost:3000
bun run build        # generate graph + bundle with minification to dist/
bun run preview      # preview production build locally
bun lint             # oxlint on src/
bun check:types      # type check with tsgo (native TS compiler)
bun run gen-edges    # regenerate src/generated-graph.ts from markdown files
bun run inspect      # ASCII scatter plot + collision report for current layout
```

## Architecture

Single-page app with no framework. All source is in `src/` (~1,200 lines). Content lives as markdown files in `public/content/`.

**Entry flow:** `main.ts` bootstraps the app - creates camera + graph, builds DOM, sets up input handlers, initializes panel, registers service worker.

**Key modules:**

- `graph.ts` - node/edge data model (interfaces + `createGraph()`). Imports auto-generated nodes and edges from `generated-graph.ts`
- `frontmatter.ts` - zero-dep YAML frontmatter parser for build-time use
- `gen-graph.ts` - build-time script that reads `public/content/**/*.md` frontmatter + `## Related projects` links, computes layout (positions, colors), generates groupings, and writes `src/generated-graph.ts` + `src/generated-groupings.ts`
- `groupings.ts` - grouping interfaces + imports generated grouping data. Groupings (ecosystem, domain, tech, status) are derived from content: `domain/`, `technology/`, `status/` markdown files define regions, node tags/status determine membership
- `camera.ts` - camera state (x, y, zoom) and tier system. Screen-to-world coordinate conversion
- `dom.ts` - DOM construction, CSS transform animations, focus/hover state
- `input.ts` - mouse/touch/wheel event handling, drag panning, zoom, WASD smooth panning, arrow key spatial navigation, Enter key confirm, keybinds schema + command palette + cheatsheet + context menu
- `card.ts` - popup quick-preview card shown on node click
- `minimap.ts` - canvas-based minimap for spatial orientation at deep zoom, click-to-pan
- `panel.ts` - side panel that fetches and displays markdown content, with in-memory cache
- `markdown.ts` - minimal homegrown markdown-to-HTML parser (no dependencies), strips frontmatter at runtime
- `gen-headings.ts` - build-time script that extracts headings from content files for search
- `gen-pages.ts` - build-time script that generates static HTML pages from content files
- `dev.ts` - Bun-based dev server with on-demand TS compilation

**Zoom tier system** controls visibility:
- Far (zoom < 1.5): ecosystem regions only
- Mid (1.5-3.5): project dots + names
- Near (≥ 3.5): full detail

**Content pipeline:** Markdown files in `public/content/` have YAML frontmatter (label, description, tags, parent, status, url, etc.) that defines graph node metadata. At build time, `gen-graph.ts` reads all frontmatter and `## Related projects` links to generate `src/generated-graph.ts` with computed positions, colors, and edges. At runtime, markdown is fetched and parsed in-browser (frontmatter is stripped). `src/generated-graph.ts` is gitignored and regenerated on build.

**Adding a new project:** Create a markdown file in the appropriate `public/content/` subdirectory with frontmatter, then rebuild. The node will appear automatically with algorithmically-computed position and color.

**Styling** lives in `public/style.css`, shared by all collection entry points. Dark theme, responsive (side panel on desktop, bottom panel on mobile). Collection-specific overrides use `html[data-collection="..."]` selectors.

## Conventions

- Zero runtime dependencies - everything is hand-rolled
- Nix flake provides the dev environment (activated via direnv)
- Node tiers: `ecosystem` (large regions), `project` (dots), `detail` (future)
- Recent commit style uses conventional commits (feat:, fix:, style:, docs:)
- Always update docs (ROADMAP.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md) before committing if behavior changed
- Content files use YAML frontmatter as single source of truth for node metadata
- Tier and cluster assignment are data-driven: cluster configs in `public/content/cluster/*.md` declare which `directories` they own, what `tier` and `autoTags` to apply. Files without a cluster or explicit `tier:` in frontmatter are content-only (grouping regions, etc.)
- Structural tiers (region, meta) are declared in each file's frontmatter (`tier: region`, `tier: meta`)

## Essay voice — prose/* files

**Peer voice, not authoritative.** The essays speak alongside the reader, not above them.

Keep:
- Second person ("you") — intentional, load-bearing
- Rhetorical question headers — intentional manipulation, they force thinking
- All cross-links, structure, "See also" sections
- Essay length — peer doesn't mean brief

Rules:
- **No pretension.** Don't position the writer above the reader. No "here's the thing nobody talks about," no "here's what you don't realize"
- **No mic-drops.** No standalone punchy sentences used for impact ("Glue.", "And yet.", "Both are true.")
- **No fanfare.** Don't announce that something important is coming. Just say it
- **Make connections, not conclusions.** Put two things next to each other and let the reader close the gap. Don't draw THE conclusion for them
- **Still working it out.** The voice should feel like it's discovering, not like it has arrived. Share what we've found, what we've noticed, what keeps showing up
- **No negative language.** Describe the situation, point at what could be different. Negative language on a public page has no positive expected value — someone in a fine headspace gets outrage, someone already not OK gets despair. The restraint is calculated compassion
- **Project descriptions are the reference voice.** Lowercase, direct, no rhetorical performance, no effort to impress. Says the thing and stops. The essays can be longer and more structured, but the sentence-level voice should match that register

## Build tool principles — no hardcoding

**Never hardcode content-specific values in build tools (`src/gen-*.ts`, `src/inspect-*.ts`).** This means: no node IDs, no cluster name strings, no magic thresholds derived from CSS layout, no assumed positions, no directory-name switch statements.

**The goal is fully agnostic tooling.** All behavior should be driven by content and config data (frontmatter, cluster YAML), never by directory names or string matching in code. Adding a new content directory or collection should never require changing a switch statement or adding a special case to the build pipeline. Remaining special cases are technical debt to be eliminated.

Allowed structural queries (use freely):
- `node.tier` — `"region" | "artifact" | "detail" | "meta"`
- `node.parent` — containment relationship
- `node.tags` — tag-based checks (e.g. `node.tags.includes("essay")`)
- `node.cluster`, `node.status`, `node.x`, `node.y`, `node.radius` — all from generated data

Not allowed in scripts:
- `node.id.startsWith("prose/")` or any directory-prefix check — use tags instead
- CSS element dimensions (the landing panel's pixel extents aren't available at build time)
- Proximity thresholds that encode assumed layout geometry (e.g. `META_ESSAY_DIST = 160`)
- Explicit cluster name strings like `n.cluster === "meta-essays"`
- Any constant that would break silently if content is added or moved

If a layout needs a non-default ring radius, add a `ringRadius:` field to the cluster's YAML frontmatter in `public/content/cluster/` and read it in `gen-graph.ts`. Do not hardcode it in the layout script or the inspector.

## Layout / cluster system

- Cluster configs: `public/content/cluster/*.md` — each defines declarative **constraints**, not coordinates or physics params
- Cluster configs declare `directories:` to claim content directories, `tier:` and `autoTags:` for their nodes. Cluster assignment is a data lookup, not a switch statement
- Region radius must contain its ring of children: after computing child ring radius, `region.radius` must satisfy `region.radius ≥ ringR + maxChildR + margin`
- Force layout: use for clusters with meaningful edge relationships; ring layout for small/positionally-fixed clusters

## Multi-collection architecture

The site supports multiple collections sharing the same spatial graph and JS bundle. Each collection has its own HTML entry point, meta node, and visual treatment.

- Collections are defined in `src/site-config.ts` (`siteConfig.collections`)
- Each collection's entry point is generated by `gen-pages.ts` at `dist/<collection>/index.html`
- The `<html data-collection="...">` attribute drives runtime behavior and CSS theming
- `getActiveCollection()` reads the attribute at runtime; build scripts get `"default"`
- All collections' nodes live on the same graph — the graph is structure, not voice

## Layout constraints — the content author API

**Content authors declare constraints, not coordinates or parameters.** The layout algorithm is responsible for finding positions that satisfy them. Users should never need to tune numbers.

Constraint types (declared in cluster YAML frontmatter):
- `near: <node-id>` — cluster should be placed near this node (e.g. `near: meta/pteraworld`)
- `below: <node-id>`, `above: <node-id>`, `left-of: <node-id>`, `right-of: <node-id>` — relative positioning
- `visible-at: <zoom>` — all nodes in cluster should fit within a standard 1920×1080 viewport at this zoom level centered on the world origin
- Overlap is a universal constraint — nothing should overlap, ever (enforced by the algorithm, not declared per-cluster)

**Absolute coordinates (`center:`) are a code smell.** They break when other clusters move, they don't express intent, and they require manual re-tuning. Replace with relative constraints wherever possible.

**Dynamic layout is not a crutch.** Runtime adaptation to viewport size is legitimate for things genuinely unknowable at build time (phone portrait, ultrawide, etc.). But layout *intent* — clustering, proximity, relative positioning — is fixed at build time. At runtime the build-time solution is scaled/adjusted within tight bounds; it is never re-solved from scratch. Build-time layout is the ground truth.

## Force layout — parameter philosophy

Force layout parameters are **never user-facing**. They are derived from the cluster geometry and tuned automatically via a run-and-measure feedback loop at build time:

1. Derive initial params from node geometry (minDist from radii, restLen, repulsion, gravity)
2. Run simulation
3. Measure output quality across four axes:
   - **Overlap**: no two nodes intersecting
   - **Spread**: cluster bounding radius within expected range for node count
   - **Edge satisfaction**: connected pairs meaningfully closer than unconnected pairs
   - **Clustering**: nodes sharing graph neighbors should form visible spatial subgroups
4. If thresholds not met, adjust params in the direction that fixes the worst failure and re-run
5. Apply the best-scoring result across all attempts

The four metrics each have directional fixes: overlaps → more repulsion; poor edge satisfaction → more attraction; poor clustering → more attraction relative to repulsion; no cohesion → stronger gravity.

## Session Handoff

Use plan mode as a handoff mechanism when:
- A task is fully complete (committed, pushed, docs updated)
- The session has drifted from its original purpose
- Context has accumulated enough that a fresh start would help

Before entering plan mode:
- Update TODO.md with any remaining work
- Update memory files with anything worth preserving across sessions

Then enter plan mode and write a plan file that either:
- Proposes the next task if it's clear: "next up: X — see TODO.md"
- Flags that direction is needed: "task complete / session drifted — see TODO.md"

ExitPlanMode hands control back to the user to approve, redirect, or stop.
