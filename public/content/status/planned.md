## what it is

planned projects have a clear shape in mind but no code yet. the problem is understood, the approach is sketched, the scope is defined.

they exist as nodes here because they're part of the larger system - other projects reference them, depend on them, or will connect to them once they exist.

## projects

- [gels](/project/gels) - grammar inference engine
- [interconnect](/project/interconnect) - world federation protocol
- [reincarnate](/project/reincarnate) - legacy software revival
