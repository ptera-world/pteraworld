treats mathematics as a graph of structural relationships rather than a tree of fields. extracts invariants, detects recurring structural patterns across domains, and enables cross-field translation through shared intermediate representations.

## key ideas

- **math as graph** — fields are clusters in a structure graph, not branches of a tree. boundaries are historical artifacts, not structural necessities.
- **layered IRs** — no single "true" representation. multiple IR layers (surface DSL → structural IR → semantic core), like a compiler pipeline for mathematics.
- **cross-field translation** — remove artificial restrictions between disciplines. tools transfer even when formulas don't.
- **structural motifs** — recurring patterns (symmetry, duality, optimization, composition) are the high-degree hubs in the math graph.
- **pruned search** — the interesting manifold in idea-space is measure-zero. discovery is navigation, not enumeration.

## architecture

```
human math DSLs (notation, conventions, field-specific idioms)
  → structural IR (invariants, transformations, relationships)
    → semantic core (interchangeable minimal foundations)
```

each layer preserves meaning while exposing different structure. translation happens above the core. the core ensures coherence.
