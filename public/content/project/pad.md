pipe anything in, get structure out. saves to a local sqlite graph.

## what it is

anything you pipe into pad gets structured, linked, and saved. it figures out the shape of whatever you give it (command output, text, urls) and stores it in a graph where everything connects together.

it plugs into your shell, clipboard, browser, git, and vscode/vim through extensions. written in lua with bundled luajit and sqlite.

the whole idea is that it just remembers things for you, nothing more.
