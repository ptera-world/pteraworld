# How do I do things?

This is a real question. Not rhetorical. Not a setup for advice.

There are ideas sitting in your head - things you want to make, learn, try. They've been there a while. You haven't started. Or you started and stopped. And at some point the question stops being frustration and becomes genuine: how do people actually do things?

## It's not obvious

Doing things feels like it should be simple. Want thing, do thing. But it's not.

There's the gap between idea and execution. The uncertainty of whether it'll be good. The memory of past attempts that didn't go anywhere. The pull of easier things. The tiredness. The sense that maybe you need something you don't have - more time, more skill, more certainty, more permission.

This isn't weakness. It's just... how it is, a lot of the time.

## What seems to help

Not a system. Not productivity advice. Just patterns that seem to make it easier:

**Making it small.** Not "my big project" but "what's the smallest piece I could try right now?" Small enough that it doesn't matter if it's bad. Small enough that failure is cheap. Small enough to actually start.

**Dropping the identity frame.** Not "am I a writer / artist / person who does things?" Just "I'm messing with this today." No declaration. No commitment. Just action without the weight. (More on this in [what are labels anyway?](/prose/what-are-labels-anyway))

**Accepting that first attempts are bad.** Not as a motivational slogan - actually expecting it. The first version will be rough. That's not failure; that's how it works. The goal isn't a good first attempt. The goal is a first attempt at all.

**Letting go of perfect.** Perfectionism looks like high standards. It's actually fear dressed up as quality control. "I can't put this out until it's good enough" becomes "I can't put this out." The standard becomes the wall. But nothing is perfect. Everything that exists is flawed. The choice isn't between perfect and imperfect - it's between imperfect and imaginary.

**Noticing the permission gap.** Sometimes the thing in the way is waiting - for the right moment, the right conditions, someone to say it's okay. That permission might not be coming. It might already be yours.

## When you're just lost

Sometimes the problem isn't motivation. It's that you genuinely don't know what to do. Learning an instrument. Learning a language. Drawing. 3D modeling. Animation. The skill is big and the path is invisible.

- **Pick one resource and follow it.** Not five tutorials at once. One. All the way through. It doesn't have to be the best one - it has to be one you actually do. To find a decent one: look for creators who do the thing, not just teach it. Prefer community recommendations over ads. Be skeptical of anything promising fast results or selling the dream harder than teaching the skill. Rough and free often beats polished and paid.
- **Copy before you create.** Draw the thing someone else drew. Play the song someone else wrote. Rebuild the thing that already exists. Originality comes later. First, learn the motions.
- **Find someone a few steps ahead.** Not the master - someone who was where you are recently. Ask them what they wish they knew. Watch how they work.
- **Expect the plateau.** You'll be bad for longer than you want. The progress curve isn't smooth - it's flat, then jump, then flat. That's normal. The flatness isn't failure.
- **The path appears by walking.** You don't need to see the whole route before starting. Take one step. The next step becomes visible from there.

## Things you can actually try

- **Set a timer for 15 minutes.** Do the thing until it goes off. That's it. You're not committing to finish - just to spend 15 minutes. Anyone can do 15 minutes.
- **Make the worst version on purpose.** Write the bad draft. Draw the ugly sketch. Build the broken prototype. Lower the bar to the floor so you can step over it.
- **Say the next physical action out loud.** Not "work on my project" - that's not an action. "Open the file." "Write one sentence." "Pick up the pencil." Make it concrete enough that your body knows what to do.
- **Start in the middle.** You don't have to begin at the beginning. Start wherever there's energy. The structure can come later.
- **Remove the escape routes.** Phone in another room. Close the other tabs. Make the thing you want to do the easiest option available.
- **Shrink the scope until it's embarrassing.** Not a novel - a paragraph. Not an app - a button that does one thing. Not a song - four bars. Embarrassingly small is finishable.

## The only guaranteed failure

Not trying.

If you try and it doesn't work, something happened. You learned what doesn't work, or what you don't like, or what's harder than expected. That's information.

If you don't try, nothing happens. The idea stays in your head. The question stays unanswered.

There's no guarantee that trying works. But not trying has a guaranteed outcome.
