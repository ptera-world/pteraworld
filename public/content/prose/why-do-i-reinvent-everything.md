# Why do I reinvent everything?

Every project starts the same way. You sketch an idea. You get excited. You start building. And then, inevitably, someone asks: "aren't you just reinventing the wheel?"

Yes. Probably. Let's do it anyway.

## The ritual

It's become a ritual at this point. Every single project gets the question. Sometimes you ask yourself. Sometimes someone else asks. Sometimes the LLM asks.

Are we reinventing Repology? Are we reinventing Pandoc? Are we reinventing CodeQL? Are we reinventing copyparty? Are we reinventing Tower? Are we reinventing the wheel?

The answer is almost always yes. And the answer to "should we stop?" is almost always no.

## Not because i think i can do it better

Let's be clear about what this isn't. It's not ego. It's not "I'm smarter than the people who built Pandoc." They did incredible work. Years of it. Battle-tested, community-supported, production-hardened work.

It's not about the destination. It's about [what you learn on the way](#what-if).

## What if?

The instinct isn't "I can do this better." It's "what if I do this differently?" What if document conversion wasn't a monolith but [a pipeline of tiny transforms](/project/rescribe)? What if code analysis used [Datalog instead of visitors](/project/normalize)? What if a game decompiler had [pluggable frontends and backends](/project/reincarnate) instead of one hardcoded path?

These aren't improvements. They're *explorations*. The existing tool made choices. Reasonable choices, often. But choices that closed off other paths. Reinventing is reopening those paths to see where they go.

Sometimes they go nowhere. That's fine. [Failed prototypes](/prose/why-is-perfectionism-a-trap) are how you map the territory. A dead end is still information.

## The trap the instinct avoids

"Well let's just use this because everyone else does."

That's the trap. Not because popular tools are bad. But because [popularity is a ratchet](#popularity-is-a-ratchet). Once something is standard, it's invisible. Its assumptions become your assumptions. Its limitations become "just how things are." Its paradigm becomes the only paradigm.

Spreadsheets are freeform grids because VisiCalc was a freeform grid. Note apps are documents because paper was documents. [Programming is text because teletypes were text](/prose/why-is-software-hard). Nobody chose these things. They just happened, and then they [calcified](#why-we-keep-losing-things).

Reinventing — badly, naively, from the wrong angle — is how you notice the calcification. You can't see the water you're swimming in until you try to swim in something else.

## Popularity is a ratchet

Good software sometimes wins. But winning locks everything in. The winner's API becomes the standard. The standard becomes the assumption. The assumption becomes invisible. And then when someone asks "why is it like this?" the answer is "because that's how it is."

[Excel doesn't need to be freeform](/prose/why-is-software-hard). But it is, because VisiCalc was. Notes apps don't need to be linear documents. But they are, because paper was. Filesystems don't need to be hierarchical. But they are, because directories were easier to implement than tags in 1970.

Every reinvention is a question: "what if this assumption wasn't load-bearing?" Sometimes it is. Sometimes the assumption exists for deep structural reasons and you discover those reasons the hard way. *That's also valuable.* Now you know why it's like this, instead of just accepting that it is.

## Why we keep losing things

HyperCard let anyone make interactive things. It died. Not because it was bad, but because Apple [didn't prioritize it](/prose/what-do-we-keep-losing). LambdaMOO proved that collaborative worldbuilding works. It faded. Not because the idea was wrong, but because the web ate everything.

The things we lose aren't failures. They're [unexplored branches](/prose/this-is-not-all). And once they're gone, nobody reinvents them because nobody remembers they existed.

So: reinvent. Not because the wheel is broken. Because the wheel is the only shape anyone remembers, and maybe a [triangle has interesting properties too](/prose/but).

## The cost

Let's be honest about the cost. Reinventing everything means:

- Dozens of projects at various stages of completion
- No single thing polished enough to point at and say "here, use this"
- The constant question of [whether any of this matters](/prose/am-i-just-pretending)
- A workshop full of prototypes and no products

But here's the thing. Before LLMs, reinventing a document converter would take a year. Now it takes a week. The cost of exploration collapsed. The [seven failed prototypes](/prose/why-do-i-build-tools) that used to span years now fit in a month.

That changes the calculus. When exploration is expensive, you should use the wheel. When exploration is cheap, you should question it. Not because you'll build a better wheel. But because you might discover the wheel was never the right shape for what you actually needed.

## The question underneath

"Why do you reinvent everything?" has an implied "instead of shipping something."

Fair. [Shipping is different from exploring.](/prose/why-do-i-build-tools) And exploring is more comfortable. It's always more interesting to start than to finish. Every reinvention is a fresh start disguised as progress.

But the explorations aren't random. They're all asking the same question: [why is software shaped this way, and what happens if it isn't?](/prose/why-is-software-hard) That question doesn't have a shipping date. It has a direction. And the direction is: make things that are opaque [legible](/prose/why-do-i-build-tools), make things that are locked-in [flexible](/prose/the-right-tool-for-the-job), and see what [emerges](/prose/why-do-i-build-tools#the-whole-point).
