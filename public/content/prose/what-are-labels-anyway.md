# What are labels anyway?

You're not your Myers-Briggs type. You're not your diagnosis. You're not your generation, your zodiac sign, your attachment style, your Hogwarts house.

You probably know this about other people. It's obvious that a label can't capture someone else's complexity. But [your own labels](#the-labels-you-wear) feel different - they feel like facts. Like self-knowledge. They're not. They're [stories you're living inside](#living-inside-the-story), and they [set the ceiling](#the-ceiling-you-dont-see) for what you think you can be. The strange thing is: [loosen your grip on your own labels](#what-if-you-held-them-loosely), and you'll probably stop gripping others' labels so tightly too.

## The labels you wear

Not the ones others put on you. The ones you put on yourself.

"I'm not a math person." "I'm awkward." "I'm not creative." "I'm the anxious one." "I'm bad at relationships." "I'm not a leader."

These don't feel like labels. They feel like observations. Things you learned about yourself over time. Self-awareness.

But where did they come from?

- A teacher's offhand comment when you were eight
- A pattern you noticed in adolescence and never questioned
- A test you took online that told you your "type"
- A diagnosis that became an identity
- Something you failed at once and decided meant something permanent

You collected these. You built a self-concept out of them. And now you live inside it.

## Living inside the story

Labels aren't just descriptions. They're constraints.

Once you believe you're "not creative," you [stop trying](/prose/how-do-i-do-things) creative things. Why would you? You already know the outcome. The label becomes a filter - you notice evidence that confirms it, dismiss evidence that contradicts it.

This is the part that's hard to see from inside: **you are living as if the label is true, which makes it true, which confirms the label.**

The kid labeled "gifted" who can't handle struggle - because struggle means they're not gifted anymore. The person labeled "anxious" who stops trying to change - because the label says this is just who they are. The one who "isn't good with people" who avoids social situations - and never gets better at them.

The label didn't describe a fixed reality. It created one.

## The ceiling you don't see

Your labels set boundaries on who you're allowed to become.

Not external boundaries. Internal ones. The ones you enforce on yourself without noticing.

"I could never do that - I'm not that kind of person."

What kind of person? The kind defined by a label you picked up years ago, in a different context, when you were different?

People change. Constantly. You're not who you were five years ago. But your labels might be. And if you're still living inside them, you're constraining current-you based on past-you's limitations.

The ceiling isn't real. It's a story. But you keep your head down anyway.

## Why self-labels stick

It's easier to see how labels flatten other people. You know your friend is more than "the shy one." You know your coworker is more than their job title.

But your own labels feel earned. You lived the experiences. You observed the patterns. Who would know better than you?

Except: you're also the least objective observer of yourself. You see yourself through the labels you've already applied. Confirmation bias runs deep when the subject is you.

And there's comfort in labels. They're stable. They explain things. They excuse things. "I can't help it, I'm just [label]." The label becomes a refuge from the discomfort of uncertainty, from the responsibility of change.

Letting go of a self-label means admitting you might have been wrong about yourself. That the story you've been telling isn't the only one. That's uncomfortable.

## What if you held them loosely?

Not "throw away all categories." You need concepts to understand yourself.

But: what if the labels were hypotheses instead of facts? What if "I'm anxious" became "I've been experiencing anxiety in these contexts"? What if "I'm not creative" became "I haven't found my creative mode yet"?

The shift is from identity to pattern. From permanent to contextual. From "this is what I am" to "this is what's been happening."

**Notice the function.** When you reach for a self-label, ask: what is this doing for me? Is it helping me understand, or helping me avoid trying?

**Test the edges.** Do something the label says you can't. [See what happens](/prose/how-do-i-do-things). Maybe the label was right. Maybe it wasn't. You won't know until you check.

**Update the story.** You're allowed to. The person who wrote your self-concept was younger, knew less, had different contexts. You can revise.

## What happens next

Here's the thing about loosening your own labels: it changes how you see everyone else.

If you're not your labels, neither are they. If your "awkward" was a story you could rewrite, maybe their "difficult" is too. If your ceiling was imaginary, maybe theirs is too.

You stop flattening people. Not because you decided to be more open-minded - but because you felt, from inside, how much the flattening costs.

The insight transfers. Start with yourself.
