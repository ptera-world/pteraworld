# What can I change?

"I want things to be different." Okay. What things? Different how? And what's your relationship to them?

This isn't about whether you should try to change things. It's about [seeing clearly](#seeing-the-actual-situation) what's in front of you - what you [might want to change](#what-do-you-want-to-change), [where you stand](#whats-your-relationship-to-it) in relation to it, and [what moves it](#what-are-the-leverage-points).

## What do you want to change?

Get specific. "The world" isn't actionable. What specifically?

Some things people want to change:

- How their workplace operates - the culture, the processes, the policies
- How their team functions day to day
- Their industry's norms and standards
- An open source project they depend on
- A product or service that's almost good but frustrating
- Their apartment building, their street, their neighborhood
- Their kids' school
- Local government - zoning, transit, services
- A specific law or policy
- Their online community's culture
- Their hobby scene's norms
- Their religious or social community
- Family dynamics
- How their healthcare works
- Accessibility in spaces they use
- Their own organization, from inside

Different scales. Different systems. Different leverage points.

## What's your relationship to it?

Are you inside or outside? Do you have access? Standing? History?

- Inside with influence - you're part of the thing, people listen to you
- Inside without influence - you're there but not heard
- Outside with access - you're not part of it but you can reach people who are
- Outside without access - you're affected but have no direct connection

Your position shapes what's available. Someone inside a company can change things an outsider can't. Someone outside might see things insiders are blind to. Neither is better - they're just different.

Also: what can you afford to risk? Some people can be loud. Some people need to keep their head down. Some have resources to spend. Some are [barely getting by](/prose/whats-actually-wrong). Your capacity is part of the picture.

## What are the leverage points?

Every system has places where small pressure creates larger movement. Finding them is most of the work.

- **Who decides?** Not officially - actually. Who has real influence? Whose opinion matters?
- **What do they care about?** Not what should they care about. What do they actually respond to?
- **What's the bottleneck?** Where does change get stuck? What's the thing that, if it moved, would unlock other things?
- **Who else wants this?** Are you alone or is there latent support? Can you find each other?
- **What's been tried?** Why didn't it work? What's different now?

Sometimes the leverage point is obvious. Sometimes it takes time to find. Sometimes you discover it by trying things and seeing what moves.

## What's actually available?

Given what you want to change, your relationship to it, and where the leverage points are - what can you actually do?

Some options that exist:

- **Show up.** Presence matters. At meetings, at events, in the space. Being there is information.
- **Talk to people.** One on one. Not broadcasting - conversing. Opinions move through networks.
- **Find the others.** You're probably not alone. Latent support becomes real when it finds itself.
- **Build the alternative.** If the thing should exist and doesn't, [make it](/prose/how-do-i-do-things). Even a rough version proves it's possible.
- **Document.** Write down what's happening. Make the invisible visible. Records matter.
- **Support who's already doing it.** With time, money, skills, attention. You don't have to start from scratch.
- **Use your position.** If you're inside, you can do things outsiders can't. That's not selling out - that's leverage.
- **Make it easy for others.** Lower the barrier. If you figured something out, share it.

None of these are the answer. They're options. What's right depends on the situation.

## What if you don't have time for all this?

The above is useful if you want to think strategically. But most people don't have weeks to analyze systems and find leverage points. That's fine.

Simpler version:

- **Find someone already doing it and support them.** They did the analysis. Show up, donate, amplify, help. You don't have to start from scratch.
- **Do the obvious thing.** Don't map the whole system. Just do whatever's clearly in front of you. Send the email. Go to the meeting. Sign the thing.
- **Mention it.** Talk to people about it. Not lecturing - just "hey, did you know about this?" Ideas spread through networks.
- **Give money if you have it.** If you don't have time but have resources, this is real contribution.
- **Show up once and see.** One event. One meeting. One conversation. Learn what you learn.

Not everyone needs to be a strategist. Most change happens through lots of people doing small things. The small things count.

## What if it doesn't work?

It might not. Most attempts at change don't succeed on the first try. Or the tenth.

But "didn't work" isn't the same as "wasted." You learn what doesn't move. You find out who else cares. You build relationships. You shift the landscape slightly, even if you don't reach the goal.

And sometimes things that seemed stuck suddenly move - because enough small pushes accumulated, because conditions changed, because the right moment arrived.

You don't control the outcome. You control [whether you try](/prose/how-do-i-do-things).
