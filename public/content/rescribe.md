Universal document conversion library with lossless intermediate representation. Pandoc-inspired, 50+ formats, open node kinds, fidelity tracking, and roundtrip-friendly design.

## What it is

A document converter built in Rust. Rescribe converts between 50+ document formats through an IR designed to preserve as much information as possible. Unlike Pandoc's fixed Haskell ADT, rescribe's NodeKind is a string type — the schema is open-ended.

Key design choices:

- **Open node kinds** — not limited to a fixed set of document elements
- **Property bags** — key-value properties with namespaces (semantic, style, layout, format-specific like `html:class` or `latex:env`)
- **Fidelity tracking** — warnings on conversion loss, never silent
- **Embedded resources** — images, fonts, and data as first-class ResourceMap
- **Roundtrip-friendly** — source format metadata preserved

Standard nodes: document, paragraph, heading, code_block, blockquote, list, table, figure, emphasis, strong, link, image. Optional math crate adds math_inline, fraction, matrix, etc.
