scripting and glue.

## what it is

lua is the scripting layer. small, fast, embeddable, with a runtime that fits in 200KB. perfect for configuration, orchestration, game logic, and anywhere you want behavior to be data-driven.

moonlet provides the runtime with plugin system. zone hosts the actual lua projects. wick can emit lua for embedded contexts.

the pattern: rust does the heavy lifting, lua handles the logic that should be changeable at runtime without recompilation.
