systems programming with guarantees.

## what it is

rust is the implementation language for most of rhi. memory safety without garbage collection, algebraic types, trait-based abstraction, zero-cost generics.

the tradeoffs: slower iteration, steeper learning curve, more upfront thinking. the payoffs: fewer runtime surprises, confident refactoring, performance when it matters.

most projects compile to native binaries, some target WASM for browser or plugin contexts, some expose C ABIs for FFI.
