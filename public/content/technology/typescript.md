web and applications.

## what it is

typescript for anything that runs in a browser or needs to interoperate with the web ecosystem. type safety on top of javascript, broad library ecosystem, runs everywhere via node/bun/deno.

the exo projects live here - Discord bots, local-first web apps, UI experiments. also standalone tools like keybinds that target the browser directly.

no frameworks unless necessary. vanilla DOM manipulation, direct fetch calls, minimal dependencies. the target is often under 120KB gzip.
