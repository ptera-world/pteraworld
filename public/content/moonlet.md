Lua runtime with plugin system for agentic AI execution. Multi-provider LLM client, SQLite-backed memory store, dynamic C ABI plugin loading, and capability-based security.

## What it is

The scripting backbone of rhi. Moonlet provides a LuaJIT runtime where Rust crates expose functionality to Lua scripts via a C ABI plugin system. Scripts receive capabilities through a `caps` table — no ambient authority.

Plugins:

- **llm** — multi-provider client (Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure, Gemini, Cohere, DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, Ollama, OpenRouter, Perplexity, Together, XAI)
- **embed** — embedding generation (OpenAI, Azure, Gemini, Cohere, Mistral, Ollama, Together)
- **libsql** — SQLite-backed memory store with metadata and weights
- **fs** — capability-based filesystem access
- **normalize** — code analysis integration via [normalize](/normalize)
- **sessions** — session management
- **tools** — tool execution
- **packages** — package management

## Key design decisions

- Moonlet = agency/execution (LLM, memory, running agents); moss = intelligence (analysis, understanding)
- Capability-based security: scripts receive pre-opened handles, not path strings
- C ABI plugin system for language interop
- Not hard-linked to any single analysis tool; integrates via dynamically loaded plugins
