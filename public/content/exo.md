Places to exist — digital spaces for identity, narrative, and interaction.

## What it is

exo builds tools for inhabiting digital spaces. [hologram](/hologram) is a Discord bot where entities have facts and respond via LLM-driven directives. [aspect](/aspect) is a local-first web app where everything is a card connected by edges, navigable as both a graph and an experiential place.

## What it isn't

- Not social media — the focus is on collaborative storytelling, not content feeds

## Projects

- [hologram](/hologram) — Discord bot with entity-facts model and multi-provider LLM integration
- [aspect](/aspect) — card-based identity exploration sandbox with real-time multiplayer
