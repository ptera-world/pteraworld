# What do we keep losing?

Technology isn't preserved by existence. It's preserved by continuous practice.

If the guild dies, the funding dies, the use-case disappears, the institution collapses, the knowledge becomes irrelevant — the tech evaporates, even if the idea was known.

## What has already vanished?

Roman concrete that self-heals in seawater. Formula gone for 1,500 years. Not because it was impossible — the knowledge chain just broke.

Greek fire. Damascus steel. The Antikythera mechanism — a 2,000-year-old analog computer for astronomy, with gears and differentials. Then nothing like it again for over a millennium. Not because it couldn't exist. Because no tradition carried it forward.

The pattern isn't dramatic. No fire. No catastrophe. Just: nobody kept doing it, so nobody remembered how.

## What's actually being lost?

We romanticize these as objects. Pyramids = big stones. Alexandria = burned scrolls. But the actual loss was systems.

The pyramids — we know the physics. Limestone, ramps, copper tools. What we lost was the *process culture*. The logistics, the coordination, the organizational knowledge that made it routine. It's like having source code but losing the build system, the deployment scripts, the dev culture, the institutional memory.

Alexandria wasn't just a library. It was a research institute, translation hub, education center, cross-civilizational knowledge sink. They compared versions, verified claims, cross-translated languages, preserved competing theories. When it fell, we didn't lose books — we lost the infrastructure of knowledge continuity. Even things that still existed elsewhere became fragmented, distorted, or abandoned.

Physical things survive neglect. But knowledge systems require continuous care. They can't be abandoned, defunded, deprecated, or sunset. And modern systems all can be.

## Is digital more fragile?

Stone tablets last 5,000 years. Magnetic tape lasts 50. Cloud services last as long as the company exists.

We've already lost software ecosystems, game engines, file formats, source code, tools, languages, operating systems, entire online cultures. Not through disaster — through deprecation.

No ruins. No rubble. No broken arches. Just 404s and dead repos.

We once had HyperCard — anyone could build interactive things, and many did. Apple neglected it to death. We once had spatial interfaces that remembered where things lived. Thrown away for "efficiency." Cloud9, a collaborative coding environment that proved real-time pair editing works — acquired by AWS, absorbed, effectively gone as what it was.

The technology existed. It proved useful. Then it got captured, or neglected, or superseded by something worse but better-funded.

## Did we forget how to align?

We still have megascale systems. Markets, militaries, supply chains, platforms. We can coordinate billions of people.

But almost exclusively around consumption, extraction, competition, and growth.

Not around preservation. Not continuity. Not shared memory. Not collective stewardship.

Alexandria worked because thousands of people, across cultures and languages, aligned around a single civilizational function. The pyramids worked because an entire society organized around a multi-generational project. Early universities carried knowledge across centuries.

These weren't "projects." They were civilizational organs.

We don't build those anymore. We build products. Platforms. Services. Ecosystems. APIs. Not millennium-scale institutions. Not knowledge systems designed to outlive their creators.

The internet was supposed to fix this. It made the world feel small — anyone can reach anyone, instantly, anywhere. But connection isn't closeness. We're more reachable than ever and not much closer. Billions of people on the same network, mostly consuming in parallel rather than building together.

The capacity isn't gone. The infrastructure isn't gone. The intelligence isn't gone. What's missing is the shared horizon — the cognitive category for "we are allowed to build things bigger than ourselves that aren't about power."

## Why do games keep getting it right?

Minecraft — you just join their world. You see what they're building. You can help. No screen share, no special tools, no "can you show me your screen?" The context is shared by design, so collaboration is natural.

People help each other constantly in games because the friction is zero. Not because gamers are special, but because the infrastructure doesn't get in the way.

The rest of software made collaboration so hard that we forgot it was natural. Games kept it easy, so people kept doing it.

The technology for real-time collaboration is "solved" — CRDTs exist, sync is a library. But "solved" means "exists as a library." The gap between capability existing and capability being accessible is where most things get lost.

## What does this mean for building?

If knowledge dies without practice, the answer isn't just better archives — it's composable tools that stay useful across contexts, so the practice continues.

If systems are more fragile than objects, the answer is building things that don't depend on any single institution, company, or platform to survive.

If collaboration is natural when friction is removed, the answer is removing friction — not building collaboration features on top of isolated tools.

Local-first, network-capable. Your stuff lives on your machine, syncable by design, but not dependent on anyone's cloud. Keep doors open instead of accidentally building walls.

Not because the current way is "bad." Because things that depend on continuous external support have a historical track record of disappearing.

And the things that last are the ones that don't need permission to keep existing.
