a map of things i've been exploring. projects, questions, ecosystems - positioned because of how they relate, not listed because of when they happened.

## what is this?

a graph you wander through. zoom out to see the shape of everything at once. zoom in to read details. click things to learn more. the spatial arrangement is information - things that share something are close to each other.

nothing here demands attention. no feed, no notifications, no algorithm. you choose where to look and how long to stay.

## why a graph instead of a list?

lists impose structure that has nothing to do with how ideas actually relate. you scroll, you see items in order, you pick one, you go back. the format flattens everything into sequence.

a graph lets things cluster and overlap. you can see connections without reading explanations. you can notice where your attention keeps returning. the act of navigating is part of the content.

## why does this exist?

i think about how software and people shape each other. this is one way of making that thinking visible - not as a document to read, but as a space to move through.

most of the web follows the paper model: static, linear, meant to be consumed. this is an experiment in something else. dynamic. relational. a system you probe, not a text you finish.

## how do i navigate?

- scroll to zoom
- click a node for its card, click again for the full panel
- drag to pan
- arrow keys to move between nodes
- `/` to search
