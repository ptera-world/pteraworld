tools that connect other tools.

## what it is

infrastructure projects are the plumbing. they don't do any one thing - they make other things possible. protocol bridges, format converters, runtime environments, configuration managers, interface definitions.

the goal is always the same: reduce the friction between systems that don't naturally talk to each other. make the glue invisible so you can focus on what you're actually building.
