making things that didn't exist.

## what it is

creative tools are about generation, not manipulation. you describe what you want, and something comes into being. meshes, textures, audio, vectors, expressions, UI patterns.

the common thread is constructive description - operations as values, constraints as parameters, output as an emergent property of the specification.

## projects
