working with language models.

## what it is

AI-adjacent projects use LLMs as components, not as the whole solution. multi-provider clients, tool execution, memory systems, agent coordination.

the pattern: structured interaction with models that can be swapped, combined, or replaced. no vendor lock-in, no magic, just tractable interfaces to probabilistic systems.
